What it does:
  1. It never allows Home page to load, since it contains content manipulation
  2. All dependencies that allows to load home page are made hidden
  3. "Related / similar videos" option removed - since it diverts us to some other video while watching one

How to run this:
  1. Open a desktop chrome or firefox browser
  2. Install TamperMonkey extension in it [link https://www.tampermonkey.net/]
  3. Open this link https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/431961-youtube-focusking
