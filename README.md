# Youtube_recommendation_Blocker

What it does:
  1. It never allows Home page to load, since it contains content manipulation
  2. All dependencies that allows to load home page are made hidden
  3. "Related / similar videos" option removed - since it diverts us to some other video while watching one

How to run this:
  1. Install the TamperMonkey extension in the browser
  2. Click on the "create new script" in the extension popup
  3. Paste the script.js contents
  4. Just refresh the youtube web, then automatically the changes are applied
