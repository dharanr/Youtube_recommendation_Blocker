# Youtube_recommendation_Blocker
This is basically a script that runs while loading the Youtube web
I run this by using the extension named "TamperMonkey" in the browser


What it does:
  1. It never allows Home page to load, since it contains content manipulation
  2. All dependencies that allows to load home page are made hidden
  3. "Related / similar videos" option removed - since it diverts us to some other video while watching one
